2. Go to /examples directory
3. In order to quickly generate data and see pictures:
go to jupyter_notebook_tutorial and use ipynb files with Jupyter Notebook (in case of troubles with it's installation use online server: https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb )
Note: run examples.ipynb with prelimenary uploaded file code.ipynb (on the left of site - FILES button)

If you prefer using python instead of jupyter there are run_simulator.py to simulate experiments (set the parameters in parameters.py beforehand)
<br />
If you are an experimentator and want to analyze your data use python code run_analyzer.py
It will automatically calculate ICC, ...
