1) Put your experimental and control data to this folder (txt or csv format). 
   (the files should contain lines with cluster's measured values. 
   See examples experiment.txt and control.txt) 
2) Open run_simulator.ipynb with jupyter-notebook 
3) Run every line in the code from the beginninig and see what it does
   Change function parameters as you wish to see different pictures and get an idea 
   of they influence an experimental result

Note: 1) You may have to write your file paths in the program.
      2) In case of using website jupyter run examples.ipynb with prelimenary 
         uploaded file code.ipynb (on the left of the page - FILES button)
      3) If you want to install Jupiter Notebook:
         1. https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb
         2. Upload notebook /new/code.ipynb via github. 
            Use URL:  https://github.com/juliaLopanskaia/nested_data_simulator.git
         3. Download this notebook.
         4. Upload notebook /new/data_analyzer.ipynb or /new/examples.ipynb via github. 
            Use URL:  https://github.com/juliaLopanskaia/nested_data_simulator.git
